**Key Concepts:**

- Machine Learning Classification Algorithms:
  
  Models such as RandomForest, Logistic Regression, SVM, etc., are trained on historical transaction data to learn patterns of fraud.

- Data Imbalance Handling:
  
  Fraud cases are rare compared to normal ones so techniques like SMOTE, undersampling, or class weighting are often applied.
