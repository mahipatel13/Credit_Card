# Credit_Card

##Goal:
- To build a classification model that accurately identifies fraudulent credit card transactions from a dataset, minimizing false negatives and false positives

##Objective:
- The primary objective of this project is to develop a classification model that can accurately identify fraudulent credit card transactions. The key focus is on minimizing false negatives and false positives, ensuring both security and user satisfaction.

# Key Concepts:
- Machine Learning Classification Algorithms:
  Models such as RandomForest, Logistic Regression, SVM, etc., are trained on historical transaction data to learn patterns of fraud.

- Data Imbalance Handling:
 Fraud cases are rare compared to normal ones so techniques like SMOTE, undersampling, or class weighting are often applied.
